Buzz numbers are numbers that are either divisible by 7 or end with 7.
A Palindromic number is symmetrical; in other words, it stays the same regardless of whether we read it from left or right.
A Duck number is a positive number that contains zeroes.
A number is said to be Spy if the sum of all digits is equal to the product of all digits.
Gapful numbers contain at least 3 digits and are divisible by the concatenation of its first and last digit without a remainder.
N is a sunny number if N+1 is a perfect square number.
A number is a Jumping number if the adjacent digits inside the number differ by 1. 
A happy number is a number that reaches 1 after a sequence during which the number is replaced by the sum of each digit squares. A number that is not happy is called Sad.
